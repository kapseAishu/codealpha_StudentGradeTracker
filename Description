1.Student Data Management:
   I defined a Student class with three fields:
   - name: The student’s name.
   - letterGrade: The grade in letter format (e.g., A, B+).
   - numericGrade: The corresponding numeric grade (e.g., 93 for A).

2.Grade Conversion:
implemented a convertGrade() method that converts letter grades to numeric scores using a switch statement.

3.User Input:
The program prompts the user to enter the number of students.
For each student, it collects:Name,Letter grade (validates it using the convertGrade method).

4.Storage:
All student objects are stored in an ArrayList<Student> for dynamic management.

5.Calculations:
  - Calculates the average, highest, and lowest numeric grades.
  - Tracks the student(s) with the highest and lowest scores.

6.Output:
- Displays a student report showing each student’s name, letter grade, and numeric grade.
- Prints a summary report including: Average grade,Highest grade and student name
,Lowest grade and student name
